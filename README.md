# Comunica Examples

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/comunica/examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/comunica/examples)
[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/comunica.png)](https://gitter.im/comunica/Lobby)

This is a repository of [Comunica](https://github.com/comunica/comunica) examples.

The packages in this monorepo are just created as an illustration on how packages can be created that make use of Comunica,
they are not published to npm.
All of these examples are available under the MIT license,
so you are welcome to reuse any code from these examples any way you want.

These examples are not meant to form fully detailed tutorials on how to build applications with Comunica.
Instead, they represent fully functional packages with detailed documentation so that they can be used and adjusted as needed.
If you are looking for detailed documentation for using and modifying Comunica,
please refer to [our website](https://comunica.dev/docs/).

All of these examples make use of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
a typed superset of JavaScript.
TypeScript is not a requirement for using Comunica.
All these examples will still work when removing all TypeScript configs
and removing all typings from the `.ts` files. 

## Examples

### Configure a custom Comunica SPARQL instance

* [Replacing the HTTP actor with a Solid HTTP actor](https://github.com/comunica/examples/blob/master/packages/configure-sparql-http-solid/)

### Create a new Comunica actor

* [Observe all received RDF triples](https://github.com/comunica/examples/blob/master/packages/actor-observe-rdf-dereference/)
* [Query over a JSON weather API](https://github.com/comunica/examples/blob/master/packages/actor-rdf-resolve-quad-pattern-api-weather/)

## Contributing new examples

If you want to add examples to this repo,
or if you want to fix mistakes in existing examples,
you can clone and set up this repo as follows.

These examples require [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) 10.0 or higher and the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) package manager.

This project can be setup by cloning and installing it as follows:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/comunica/examples.git
$ cd examples
$ yarn install
```

**Note: `npm install` is not supported at the moment, as this project makes use of Yarn's [workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) functionality**

This will install the dependencies of all modules, and bootstrap the Lerna monorepo.
After that, all [example packages](https://github.com/comunica/examples/tree/master/packages) are available in the `packages/` folder.

Furthermore, this will add [pre-commit hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pre-commit)
to build, lint and test.
These hooks can temporarily be disabled at your own risk by adding the `-n` flag to the commit command.
